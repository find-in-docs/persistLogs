# Best way to keep track of your dependencies with your own repos are to get the modules
# from your own directory. This way, you update the source module, check it into github,
# but access it locally. To do this, issue the following commands:
#   go mod edit -replace=github.com/samirgadkari/sidecar@v0.0.0-unpublished=../sidecar
#   go get -d github.com/samirgadkari/sidecar@v0.0.0-unpublished
# This will get the repo from ../sidecar, and use it as if it is the latest version of
# github.com/samirgadkari/sidecar
